New Cargoes adds a range of new cargo types to the universe.

All new cargo types are "specialist" forms of the generic cargo
types. So, for instance, "Sunflower Seeds" might be added. These would
appear in the cargo bay as 1TC of Food, and can be sold on the F8
market as Food if you want.

Alternatively (and more usefully!), the F4 screen can be used to enter
the specialist market. There you can buy the local specialities, and
sell any specialist cargo in your hold. Specialities are generally
more expensive to buy than the generic cargo, but if sold in the right
place can give massive profits.

You can also listen to the latest trading rumours - mostly true ones -
about the best trade routes, and enter the trade floor to look for
more lucrative deals.
