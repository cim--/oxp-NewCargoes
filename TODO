Sometimes add Open Contract sources to OXP stations

Add storage facilities at about 1/3 of systems (no particular pattern)
which will hold on to cargo for 1-3Cr/TC/day (cheaper in lower-tech
systems). Likely to mostly be a waste of money for all but the best
traders, but has some interesting potential uses. Cheaper storage has a very
small chance (1% per day at most?) of being raided; the more expensive
storage might also be raided but some of that money goes on guards and
insurance.
